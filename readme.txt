Lets you create individual notification rules to be informed about all post status transitions of your blog. Features custom email texts with many placeholders and custom post types.

== Description ==

= Notify everything! =

You want to **be notified** when one of your contributors have submitted a new post for revision or an editor published one? Vice versa you want to **notify your contributors** when their posts got published?
This is just the beginning of what you can achieve with Post Status Notifier (PSN)!

It works with all kind of **custom post types**, supports all **custom taxonomies** like categories and tags other plugins are using. You can grab all these taxonomy values and custom fields attached to a post and use them as **placeholders** in your custom notification texts. Define as many notification rules as you need with all kind of settings, like custom Cc, Bcc and From emails addresses.

PSN works great with plugins like **WP Job Manager**, **Crowdfunding by Astoundify** or **Advanced Custom Fields**, just to name a few. The possibilities are endless. Want to **automate your publishing workflow** with [Buffer](http://bufferapp.com/)? No problem!
